    - name: 'randPedPCA: Rapid approximation of principal components from large pedigrees'
      journal: Genetics Selection Evolution
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee 
      author: Rosalind F. Craddock, Gregor Gorjanc, and Hannes Becher
      year: 2025
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12711-025-00994-y 
      description: Pedigree contains rich information about the relationship between individuals. The rapidly growing size of pedigrees poses a computational challenge in effectively visualizing the information encoded in the pedigree. To this end, we developed randPedPCA that can run principal component analysis of millions of individuals recorded in a pedigree. 

    - name: 'Admixed and single-continental genome segments of the same ancestry have distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns'
      journal: Genome Biology
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee*, Moo Hyuk Lee*
      author: Kangcheng Hou, Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Buhm Han
      year: 2025
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-025-03672-w
      description: We analyze two popular GWAS methods, standard GWAS and Tractor, through a population genetic lens. Admixed genomes offer higher power compared to multi-ancestry single-continental genomes of the same size if analyzed by standard GWAS, but not with Tractor. We show that linkage disequilibrium is not limited within ancestry segments of admixed genomes, making ancestry-specific Tractor estimates different from their single-continental counterparts. 

    - name: 'Pseudobulk with proper offsets has the same statistical properties as generalized linear mixed models in single-cell case-control studies'
      journal: Bioinformatics
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2024
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae498
      description: By adjusting the offset of a pseudobulk method, one can produce results that are identical to generalized linear mixed models in single-cell case-control studies. Hence, the massive computational burden and convergence problems of mixed models can be avoided by using pseudobulk instead without affecting the result. 

    - name: 'FastRNA: an efficient exact solution for PCA of single-cell RNA sequencing data based on a batch-accounting count model'
      journal: American Journal of Human Genetics
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.09.008
      description: FastRNA produces batch-corrected low-dimensional representation of single-cell RNA sequencing data. We combine (1) the theory of sufficient statistics and (2) eigendecomposition to derive a completely sparse algorithm to perform feature selection and principal component analysis (PCA). The memory consumption and runtime are two to four orders of magnitude smaller than competing methods, enabling atlas-scale scRNA-seq data analysis within an ordinary personal computer.

    - name: 'A theory-based practical solution to correct for sex-differential participation bias'
      journal: Genome Biology
      fauthor: Hanbin Lee
      author: and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-022-02703-0 
      description: The paper shows that sex-differential participation bias is largely dependent to the overall participation rate of a genetic cohort under standard parameteric assumptions. The major findings are (1) selection bias is highly sensitive to the parametric choice of the participation model (2) bias due to discrete variables contributing to study participation can be mitigated through stratification under low participation rate. As a result, it raises concern on the use of commercial genetic cohorts in which the target population is poorly specified, in turn, making the overall participation rate unidentifiable. 
  
    - name: 'MarcoPolo: a clustering-free approach to the exploration of differentially expressed genes along with group information in single-cell RNA-seq data'
      journal: Nucleic Acids Research 
      fauthor: Chanwoo Kim*, Hanbin Lee*
      author: Juhee Jeong, Keehoon Jung and Buhm Han
      year: 2022
      doi: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac216 
      description: MarcoPolo prioritizes potentially important genes in a single-cell RNA sequencing data through a unique ranking system. The method first fits a bimodal Poisson distribution and uses the fitted attributes to generate ranks of genes using four distinct metrics. The process does not require preceeding clustering of cells so it is robust to clustering results which are sensitive to program parameters.
